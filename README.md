# Manga Store Front-End/Back-End Combo!

## Dependencies

Ensure npm is tracking on your dependencies.
1. Be in the root directory of the app.
2. Copy and paste this code:

```npm install express nodemon pg jsonwebtoken react react-dom react-router-dom```


## Starting servers

Starting the Front-End server will allow you to have live updates via 'Vite'.
1. Open a duplicate tab of the app root directory in terminal or iTerm2.
2. Copy and paste this code:

```npm run dev```


Starting the Back-End server wil allow you to make API calls via 'ExpressJS'.
1. Open a duplicate tab of the app root directory in terminal or iTerm2.
2. Copy and paste this code:

```npm run start:dev```


## API base url

I believe the API base url should be
```http://localhost:3000```
I will try to keep this updated as much as possible if it does not work.
